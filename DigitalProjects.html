					<p>Project-based learning including digital projects are increasingly popular across all disciplines and classrooms. Digital projects, however, can be daunting for both students and TAs! Students may struggle with project development, time management, and technological hurdles such as new software. As the TA, you may struggle with overseeing numerous projects spanning an array of topics or have limited experience with the tools that your students are using. How are you supposed to keep track of 40 individual projects and troubleshoot software glitches on the fly? </p>

					<br>

					<h4>In this workshop...</h4>
					<p>We will review digital projects and their role in the classroom. We’ll also cover a series of project management strategies that will help you and your students successfully work through digital projects. We’ll also discuss some tips and tricks for digital projects in the classroom. And don’t worry! You’re not alone. There are plenty of campus resources to help get you through digital projects!

					<h3>What are digital projects and why incorporate them? </h3>

					<p>Digital projects take a variety of forms ranging from websites, blogs, presentations, videos, photography, multi-media stories, graphics, and maps that are hosted online or are shared on screen. Digital projects are pedagogical or teaching strategies that promote hands-on and active learning. Some courses may have labs or small digital assignments throughout the semester and some build up to a large-scale, final digital project. </p>

					<br>

					<h2 class="projectPage">Project Development</h2>

					<br>

					<p>Digital projects require a significant amount of time and planning. Even if the projects aren’t due until the end of the semester, you want your students to begin thinking about them as soon as possible. </p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					

					<h3>Brainstorming Digital Projects <i>Individually</i></h3>

					<p>Remind your students throughout the semester about the digital project. Ask your students to write down their project idea or their top three ideas at the beginning or end of a class period. This can be a low-stakes, ungraded brainstorm and students can provide as much or as little details as they have. The point is to get them thinking about the project early on. You could do this a more than once if need be because it doesn’t have to take much time.</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>


					<h3>Brainstorming Digital Projects <i>Collectively</i></h3>

					<p>Have your students pair up or team up in small groups to brainstorm their projects. Students can help each other flush out ideas as you jump from group to group. Collective brainstorming will also help develop comradery and support in the classroom as students learn about each other’s interests. This is a huge asset going into digital projects!</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>


					<h3><a href="assets/ProjectProposal.png">Digital Project Proposals</h3>

					<p>Once your students have had ample time to brainstorm, ask them for a written project proposal. These can be graded or ungraded but should be more formalized than the brainstorming activities. Ask your students to solidify an idea through writing. Things to ask for in a proposal:</p>

					<br>

					<h4>Title</h4>

					<h4>Topic</h4>

					<h4>Description</h4>

					<h4>Why?</h4>

					<h4>Resources and Data</h4>

					<h4><a href="assets/Wireframes_RothEtAl2017.jpg">Sketch</a></h4>

					<h4>Scope</h4>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>


					<h3>Workshopping Digital Project Proposals</a></h3>

					<p>If time allows, have students bring multiple copies of their proposals to class and have them workshop their proposals collectively. Ask students to provide informal, on-the-fly feedback in person and then ask them to provide more formal feedback after rereading the proposal. Canvas discussion boards are great for collecting/grading this feedback! </p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>


					<h3>Final Project Proposals and TA Feedback</h3>

					<p>Now that students have brainstormed and finalized an idea, it’s your turn to provide feedback. This can take a variety of forms. You can read and provide written feedback. If possible, I also suggest meeting with each student to discuss their proposals. Make sure these meetings are short and sweet. I’ve found that early feedback and interventions dramatically impact digital project progress</p>

					<br>

					<p>Lastly, encourage students to work collectively and come to your office hours!</p>

					<h2 class="projectPage">Tips and Tricks</h2>

					<h3>Examples</h3>

					<p>Inspire your students throughout the semester! Share and discuss digital projects from the news, blogs, or past semester final projects. Examples help get the mind going and help students envision the possibilities. </p>

					<br>

					<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/16/us/politics/the-two-americas-of-2016.html">New York Times</a></p>

					<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/07/illegal-giant-fish-cambodia-vietnam-cuisine-delicacy-wildlife-watch/">National Geographic</a></p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<h3>Important!!</h3>

					<p>You MUST ask previous students for their permission to share their projects. If you haven’t taught the course before, ask former TAs for examples. Focus on positive examples.</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>


					<h3><a href="assets/LearnUW.png">Collective Examples</a></h3>

					<p>Create a discussion board on Canvas for students to post digital projects that they’ve found and enjoy! In class, ask students to describe the projects they’ve post and why they like it. What works and what doesn’t work? Why? Make sure they provide attribution in their examples too!</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Critique and Engagement</h3>

					<p>Use these examples in constructive critiques. In the beginning, walk your students through a critique and facilitate the conversation. Teaching students how to effectively and meaningfully critique is crucial. Ask students to critique existing projects individually, in pairs, and in small groups. Finally, have students critique each other’s work. Emphasize constructive feedback and encourage multiple layers of engagement. </p>
					<br>

					<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/07/illegal-giant-fish-cambodia-vietnam-cuisine-delicacy-wildlife-watch/">National Geographic</a></p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Demos</h3>

					<p>If you have time in front of your students and there are specific tools that they are using, try some live demos! This can be really daunting task because demos can go completely awry. The important thing is to work through a particular workflow with your students and then have them apply the same concepts to their own project. Also, if your demo goes bonkers, this is a great time to demonstrate troubleshooting. You can also screen capture your demos and post them online to Canvas! This is super helpful as a resource later on too.</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Avoid Taking Your Student’s Mouse</h3>

					<p>When helping students one-on-one, avoid “driving” your student’s mouse. Let your student drive as you assist or describe a particular workflow. This may be slower, but is really valuable!</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Office Hours</h3>

					<p>Digital projects are very hands-on for students and offering a variety of office hours types will help you navigate time demands and protect your time. </p>

					<br>

					<h4>Additional Office Hours</h4>

					<p>In general, you may want to add additional structured time for office hours during digital project assignments. This additional time will hopefully offset student requests for additional meetings outside of your office hours. </p>

					<br>

					<h4>Two Settings</h4>

					<p>You may also want to divide your office hours into two settings. You can host some of your office hours in the lab setting to provide technical support and then host some in your office hours in your office to think about bigger picture components of the project. </p>

					<br>

					<h4>Collective Office hours</h4>

					<p>Reserve a computer lab or a space for your students to collectively work on their digital projects on a weekly basis. You don’t have to be there, but by having collective office hours, students know peer support will be there! This is a great way for students to connect, help, and motivate one another.</p>


					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Grading</h3>

					<p>Digital projects are often difficult to grade because each topic and medium is very different. Here are some strategies for grading.</p>

					<br>

					<h4><a href="572_Lab2.pdf">Mile Markers</a></h4>

					<p>Once projects are underway, schedule mile markers or check-in points that count towards their project grade. Mile markers help students keep up with time management and progress. Ask students for updates about where they are at, their successes thus far, and any sticking points.</p>

					<br>

					<h4>Feedback</h4>

					<p>Different kinds of feedback throughout the development and completion of a digital project are key. Create opportunities to provide feedback and collective feedback. Digital projects should be in good shape if feedback is iterative. This makes grading much easier!</p>

					<br>

					<h4>Rubrics vs. Written Feedback</h4>

					<p>Formal grading strategies are up to you and your supervising professor! Some professors require a rubric and others do not. We won’t debate this here, but the more feedback you give, the further justified a grade becomes. Feedback also supports transparent grading and reveals reasoning behind the grade. I ask students to reflect on their grades for a couple days before contacting me, but be open to in-person dialog. </p>

					<br>

					<h4>Reflections</h4>

					<p>Submitting a reflection with a digital project or after submission is a great way to understand the progression of a project. Ask students to write about their workflow as well as the ups and downs of a project. How did the project change from the beginning to the end? Is the project what they envisioned? Is there anything they didn’t get to or something they would love to include in the next iteration? What did the student learn and what will they utilize going forward? Reflections provide insight and help contextualize projects before you grade them.</p>

					<h2 class="projectPage">Resources</h2>

					<br>

					<p>Students working on digital projects come from a variety of backgrounds. Some may have plenty of experience working with technology while others may be far from proficient. Either way, there are resources to help you and your students!</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Google</h3>

					<p>Asking the internet for help can be extremely helpful, but it can also be a rabbit hole. Students might need a primer on how to ask Google for help and to be efficient in finding an answer. First, have students start with the “Help Information” provided on a tool’s webpage. If students move to Google, review key concepts for your digital projects which will help streamline any Google search. During class or lab, provide a quick demo on troubleshooting a question. Further, politely ask students to help each other and “Google It” before calling on you in for help. This helps them troubleshoot, but also alleviates pressure for you to have all of the answers.</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Campus Resources</h3>

					<p>Campus has a bunch of resources to help you out and there are also plenty of online open source resources available. Below are a few that I suggest: </p>
