					<h2 class="page-header">Overview <i>Graphic Design in Cartography </i></h2>

					<p>Geography 572 (G572) provides an in-depth examination of advanced themes and
					topics in cartographic design. G572 is an extension of the G370 course, but with a
					focus on cartographic design for the web rather than print and the intersection of
					cartographic design with graphic design, web design, and the digital humanities.
					Specifically, G572 integrates <i>theory</i> (new ways of critically examining cartography) and <i>practice</i> (cartographic implementation) emphasizing the design of webdelivered static maps, rather than the design of interfaces for manipulating these maps.
					</p>

					<p>My current syllabus and course schedule is available <a href="assets/Fall2017_572syllabus.pdf">here</a>.</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Inclusion and Engagement</h4>
					<p>Inclusion and engagement are key components of my teaching philosophy. As such, we embrace all students, including and
					especially: people of color, LGBTQIA people, non-citizen residents (of any status) and
					Native Americans, Muslims, Jews, and members of all other faiths, atheists &
					agnostics, women, disabled people, and disaffected people. We will actively work to
					ensure that everyone is welcome and is invited to share their perspectives. We will
					respect and support one another. </p>

					<p>I'm still working on fostering an inclusive environment. Below are my current strategies and I would love suggestions!</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p><i>Classroom layout:</i> I arrange the seats into a circle / u-shape.</p></li>
						<li><p><i>Name plates:</i> Each students has a name card on displayed on her/his/their desk.</p></li>
						<li><p><i>Remembering names:</i> I had out each name plate at the beginning of class.</p></li>
						<li><p><i>Avoiding the podium:</i> I limit my time in front of the class lecturing. I prefer to sit in the circle with my students.</p></li>
						<li><p><i>Preparation:</i> Students are asked to come prepared to class having read/viewed the assigned material. At the beginning of class, I provide prompts and have students take a few moments to write down their thoughts on the assigned readings. I hope this helps spur conversation and increase engagement with the material</p>
					</ul>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Readings</h4>

					<p>Students are asked to complete a series of readings before class on Wednesdays. The readings address the topic or lens for week in a variety of ways. My goal is to combine academic articles with additional and alternative sources of knowledge. For example, I may ask students to read blog posts, tutorials, and news articles. I also aim to incorporate other multimedia sources like videos or to review existing maps.</p>


					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Free Write and Discussion</h4>
						
					<p>As mentioned above, students are assigned reading material that directly relates to the cartographic theme of
					the week. In class, they are asked to write a short reflection about the assigned
					readings and theme of the week. I provide questions or prompts to get students
					engaged in thinking and writing. To receive full credit, students come to class prepared having read or
					watched the assigned materials. Additionally, the free writes encourage and help
					guide class discussion.</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Objects</h4>

					<p>In this class, students help curate course material by submitting map
					examples, graphics, articles, videos, or material related to the course. I provide
					prompts and ask students to submit a related object each week before class (usually Fridays).
					Students submit each object online and come to
					class prepared to talk about their objects!</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Lecture Activities</h4>
					
					<p>Lecture activities take a variety of shapes, including class
					discussions of readings, critiques, peer feedback, group work, and mapping
					exercises. Fridays are reserved for activities and are generally held in the lab room. The goal is to learn from each other and learn from “doing”.
					In mapping exercises, for example, students will put cartographic themes from assigned
					readings, discussions, and my lectures to practice. Additionally, extra lab experience
					benefits their cartographic skills development.</p>

					<p>I should note that the activities mentioned above are in addition to traditional lab assignments. I also save time for a bit of lecture. I'm not going completely rogue (yet)!</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Objects</h4>
						<h4><i>Defining the Map</i></h4>

						<p>By default, maps are political and powerful objects. As a result, the very definition of a map matters. To receive full credit for this assignment, I asked students to submit to a discussion post a definition of a map. This can be in their own words or can be borrown from someone else (as long as they give recognition).</p>

						<p>Students then used these definitions in the Lecture Activity below.</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Lecture Activities</h4>

						<p>For this Lecture Activity, students were paired up to introduce and discuss their Object or map definitions. I asked them to compare similarities and difference in terminology as well as the connotations produced by each definition.</p>

						<p><a href="assets/Fall2017_572_LectureActivities_Week1_MapDefinitions.pdf">Lecture Activity Handout</a></p>

						<p>I combined all Objects or map definitions into one word cloud and as a class, we narrowed down a few working definition. The goal was not prescriptive. I wanted students to think about their own perspectives and the assumptions within their experiences as cartographers.</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Notes and Reflections</h4>
						<p>One of the best pieces of this class is the fact that it's an upper-level course. Everyone in class is in there for a reason. There's a mix of students from undergraduates to certificate students. They have all taken Intro to Cartography (Geog 370), but with varying teachers and varying perspectives. All in all, there is a ton of excitement! The students are ready to go!</p>

						<p>The first day of class (Wednesday) was the typical "syllabus day". After going through course content and goals, we did a round of introductions and spent time on Free Write #1. This was a really good way to get to know students quickly without the pressure of verbal introductions.</p>

						<p>On Friday, we jumped right into course material beginning with Free Write # 2. Class discussion on the assigned readings was a bit rough, but I think that might be a remnant of the first week of class. It's something to keep an eye on though. We then moved to the lab for this week's Lecture Activity. The best part of the Lecture Activity was the buzz of students talking and working together. Regardless of actvity's actually outcome, this was awesome to see!</p>

						<h4><i>Story or Narrative Map</i></h4>

						<p>Maps have a long and interconnected history with stories and narrative. Most recently, however, story maps, visual storytelling, and narrative have become buzz words in cartography and data journalism (among many other fields). For this Object assignment, I asked students to upload one of their favorite story maps, narrative maps, or any map incorporated into a story.</p>

						<p>Students then used these map examples in the <i>Lecture Activity</i> below.</p>

					<h4 class="teaching_outline">Notes and Reflections</h4>
						<p>I really had fun this week in class because my work has always been inspired by the inclusion of stories and narratives in cartography. I'm particularly inspired by Sébastien Caquard and Margaret Pearce's (my former advisor at the University of Kansas) work. Discussion with students this week was easy. Stories and narrative are buzz words in contemporary cartography and whether or not they read the material, they had plenty to say. Students also seemed very interested in the story-esque maps that I provided as assigned readings. We explored the similarites and differences in narrative and storytelling techniques across the examples. We then dove more closely into Margaret Pearce's techniques in <i>Framing the Days</i>.</p>

						<p>One pedagogical question arose this week, "what is the role of required reading?" I don't have any exams, but I do have short quizzes on all readings, discussion, and lecture material. The only way I really gauge their reading, however, is through Free Writes and discussion in class. I try to avoid completely regurgitating the readings in my lecture. In some ways, students just "miss out" on related material if they haven't read.</p>

						<p>Furthermore, I try to provide at least two Free Write prompts that are directly related to the assigned readings and two that are more open ended. This allows those who didn't read to participate and engage in thought, in writing, and in conversation. I personally think the readings supplement and add to the discussion in numerous ways, but I'm definitely bias given my interest in the material. I hope to provide relevant and interesting readings from various outlets (not just academic articles, but blogs, maps, news articles, tutorials, videos, etc.) I know others who do not have any assigned readings. I know other who don't assign any readings or text. Long story short, should I care if students complete the readings?</p>

						<p>The Object assignment and Lecture Activity this week asked students to submit their favorite story or narrative map examples. We then explored and documented specific storytelling and cartographic techniques that were used in the map examples. Students worked in groups of two or three, which I <i>highly</i> suggest. Students jumped right into the Lecture Activity and were able to talk through the map examples together. Also, this cuts grading in half, which is a major win for me! I plan on creating a composite list of the techniques, so stay tuned!</p>

						<p>In other news, I've discovered that I trip on nearly everything when I teach. The comedic relief comes in handy.</p>
